      " This document is a High Court judgment from Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, dated August 10, 2023, regarding Criminal Appeal No. 23/2013. The appeal was filed by Yog Raj against his conviction by the Sessions Judge, Udhampur, for rape under Section 376 of the RPC. The trial court had sentenced Yog Raj to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 for raping his own daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appellant challenged the conviction, arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, the witnesses' statements were not credible, and the medical evidence did not support the rape allegation. The court considered the arguments and evidence presented, including the prosecutrix's testimony, her mother's complaint, medical evidence, and the defense witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The High Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, upholding the trial court's judgment. They found the prosecutrix's testimony credible, supported by medical evidence, and that the prosecution had proven the rape beyond a reasonable doubt. The High Court also emphasized the severity of the crime, especially given that the perpetrator was the victim's father, and found no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed. The High Court affirmed the life sentence and fine.\n",

      " This is a judgment from the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, dated August 10, 2023, concerning an appeal (CRA No. 23/2013) by Yog Raj against his life imprisonment sentence for rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  The lower court found Yog Raj guilty based on the testimony of the victim (his 13-year-old daughter) and supporting medical evidence, which included evidence of recent intercourse and a vaginal abrasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appeal argued that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, citing inconsistencies between the victim's statements and her mother's initial complaint, and the lack of a DNA test linking the accused to the semen found.  The defense suggested the case was fabricated due to strained relations between Yog Raj and his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The High Court rejected the appeal.  While acknowledging minor inconsistencies and the lack of a DNA test, the court deemed the victim's testimony credible and sufficiently corroborated by the medical evidence.  The court cited precedent establishing that a victim's testimony alone can suffice for conviction in rape cases unless compelling reasons exist to demand corroboration. The court upheld the life imprisonment sentence, citing the heinous nature of the crime, particularly given the perpetrator's relationship to the victim.  The judgment emphasizes that the absence of a DNA test, while a deficiency in the investigation, didn't undermine the overall strength of the prosecution's case.\n",
